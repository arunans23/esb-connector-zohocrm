Pre-requisites:

 - Maven 3.x
 - Java 1.6 or above
 - The org.wso2.esb.integration.integration-base project is required. The test suite has been configured to download this project automatically. If the automatic download fails, download the following project and compile it using the mvn clean install command to update your local repository:
         https://github.com/wso2-extensions/esb-connector-integrationbase

Tested Platform:

 - Microsoft WINDOWS V-7
 - UBUNTU 13.04, 14.04
 - Mac OSx 10.9

STEPS:

 1. Follow the below mentioned steps for adding valid certificates to access Zoho CRM API over https. If the certificates are already available in keystores, you can skip this step.
 
	1)	Extract the certificate from browser by navigating to https://www.zohocrm.com/ and place the certificate file in following locations. 
			- <ZOHOCRM_CONNECTOR_HOME>/src/test/resources/keystores/products
			- <ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security

	i)  Navigate to the "<ZOHOCRM_CONNECTOR_HOME>/src/test/resources/keystores/products" location from command prompt and execute the following command to import zohocrm certificate in to keystore. Give "wso2carbon" as password.
			keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore wso2carbon.jks -alias "CERT_NAME".
			NOTE : 	CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was extracted from zohocrm with  the extension, change it accordingly (e.g. zohocrm.crt).
					CERT_NAME is an arbitrary name for the certificate. (e.g. zohocrm)
	ii) Navigate to the "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security" location from command prompt and execute the following command to import zohocrm certificate in to keystore. Give "wso2carbon" as password.
			keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore client-truststore.jks -alias "CERT_NAME".
			NOTE : 	CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was extracted from zohocrm with  the extension, change it accordingly (e.g. zohocrm.crt).
					CERT_NAME is an arbitrary name for the certificate. (e.g. zohocrm)
	
 2. The ESB should be configured as below;
	Please make sure that the below mentioned Axis configurations are enabled in <ESB_HOME>/repository/conf/axis2/axis2.xml folder.
   
    <messageFormatter contentType="text/html" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.ExpandingMessageFormatter"/>
	
    <messageBuilder contentType="text/html"	class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.BinaryRelayBuilder"/>
	
	<messageFormatter contentType="application/jsonp" class="org.apache.synapse.commons.json.JsonStreamFormatter"/>
	
	<messageBuilder contentType="application/jsonp" class="org.apache.synapse.commons.json.JsonStreamBuilder"/>

	<messageFormatter contentType="multipart/form-data" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.ExpandingMessageFormatter"/>

    <messageBuilder contentType="multipart/form-data" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.BinaryRelayBuilder"/>

	Note: Add the aforementioned message formatters and the message builder to the axis file, if they are not available by default.
